# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST, TensorFlow, and OpenCV

This project demonstrates a basic neural network built with TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It includes functionality to predict digits from custom images using OpenCV.

## Features

- Loads and normalizes the MNIST dataset
- Builds a feed-forward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras
- Trains the model and evaluates accuracy on test data
- Reads external images (e.g., `1.png`, `2.png`, etc.) and predicts their digit using the trained model
- Visualizes the predictions using Matplotlib

## Requirements

Install the following libraries before running the code:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python pandas
